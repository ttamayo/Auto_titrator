# Autotitrator

This repo contains test of each of the different components 
of an automatic titrator 
controlled with a Raspberry Pi.

## Before you start keep in mind:

### Power supply:
* Before connecting anything you should double check the voltage and the current, you might burn a circuit or cause an accident.

### Testing:

* If it is possible before connecting everything to a single power supply, test everything with a regular wall power source. (It might not be possible with the steeper pumps).

* For building a propotype it is ok to use jumpers and alligators, after that
use a permaboard or/and use a more permanent wiring.

* Check frequently if the voltage and current is the adequate.

* Do not leave any open wire, use electic tape to cover it.

* Keep all the circuits an wiring far form liquids.
