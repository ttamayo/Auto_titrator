    "The Inter-integrated Circuit (I2C) Protocol is a protocol intended to allow multiple “slave” digital integrated circuits (“chips”) to communicate with one or more “master” chips. Like the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), it is only intended for short distance communications within a single device. \n",

    "In our sensor we'll use the buses SDA and SCL. SCL is the clock signal, and SDA is the data signal. The whole protocol allow us to read and write on specific registers. This will help us to set up the sensor, for example configuring the type of measurement that we want. Later, we will be able to read the current registered values for the green, blue or red sensor.\n",
