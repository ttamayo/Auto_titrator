    "\n",
    "The thermistor voltage is an analogous signal given by the outlet of our vernier sensor interface shield. The serial/analogous signal consists of a protocol for sending an organized message sequentially and has the advantage that we can obtain actual numbers from them. Unfortunately, the Raspberry pi doesn't have a serial port, so he can't read it directly. Instead we will use an ADC converter, that changes this signal into an 8 bits number using some pins built in SPI protocol (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface). For our titration, we'll use the MCP3008 (https://stevieb9.github.io/rpi-adc-mcp3008/datasheet/MCP3008.pdf). The SPI protocol for this converter is already included in the RPIO module. \n",
